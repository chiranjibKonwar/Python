Random forests usually work well even on very large datasets, and training can easily
be parallelized over many CPU cores within a powerful computer. However, random
forests require more memory and are slower to train and to predict than linear mod‐
els. If time and memory are important in an application, it might make sense to use a
linear model instead. Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from data. It is a research field at the
intersection of statistics, artificial intelligence and computer science, which is also
known as predictive analytics or statistical learning. The application of machine
learning methods has in recent years become ubiquitous in everyday life. From auto‐
matic recommendations of which movies to watch, to what food to order or which
products to buy, to personalized online radio and recognizing your friends in your
photos, many modern websites and devices have machine learning algorithms at their
core. When you look at at complex websites like Facebook, Amazon or Netflix, it is very
likely that every part of the website you are looking at contains multiple machine
learning models.
